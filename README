We have four major data layers we want:

    - rail
    - ports
    - warehouses
    - roads/highways

And we want them in North America:

    - USA
    - Mexico
    - Canada

North American port data comes from:

    - http://msi.nga.mil/MSISiteContent/StaticFiles/NAV_PUBS/WPI/WPI_Shapefile.zip

North American rail data comes from:

    - http://cta.ornl.gov/transnet/qc28R.zip
    - http://cta.ornl.gov/transnet/qn28V.zip
    - http://cta.ornl.gov/transnet/wconv.txt
    - http://cta.ornl.gov/transnet/QNdata.zip

North American warehouse data is currently restricted only to Target and Walmart
distribution centers, and it comes from:

    - http://www.mwpvl.com/html/walmart.html
    - https://corporate.target.com/_ui/js/main.comb.xml

The shapefiles are imported directly into a PostGIS-enabled
database. Other data sources are imported into the same database
after being prepared/mangled/reformatted. Once all the data is in
the database, we make new tables in that database by joining and
selecting from the raw data tables. This produces the set of tables
that our application, finally, consumes.

The visualization will be done in d3 or leaflet using GeoJSON to render
each layer.
