Here is where we are working out how to get the data together.

We have four major data layers we want:

    - rail
    - ports
    - warehouses
    - roads/highways

And we want them in North America:

    - USA
    - Mexico
    - Canada

The visualization will eventually be done in d3 using
topojson to render each layer. So this means that we have to
find the data for each layer and normalize it, make it
convertible into json, for merging into a json file that we
can use with d3.

So, for the rail, for example, we have a basic mesh of lines available
from Natural Earth:

    http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/

But this does not have the interchanges, the names of the roads,
or any other useful data. Just the shapes.

We can get names and interchanges, and even historical ownership
data from

    http://cta.ornl.gov/transnet/RailRoads.html

But this is definitely not in topojson format. It takes some work,
and juggling of cta's file formats to even get into basic json
format. And then we still have to figure out how to inject that new
data into the gigantic bit of json can extract, using Mike Bostock's
tools, from the Natural Earth dataset. It's a matter of finding either
and ID to tie the data, or a name to tie the data to.

Except in the case of things like interchange nodes and railyards,
which are simply points, and not line segments. If there are simply
points, they can form another layer, and we don't need to worry any
further.

Roads are mostly public, so those will be no problem.

Warehouses are points, so those should be no problem, once we have the
data.

Ports are obviously points/areas, and no problem.

So, step 1 is getting this data, and getting it to the point where
we can work with it in d3 and leaflet.
