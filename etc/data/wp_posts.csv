<strong>Port expansion:</strong>

The Port of Oakland recently completed a $600 million expansion at the seaport. This encompassed 2 new marine terminals, an intermodal rail terminal, realignment of roadways, dredging, and a 38+ acre public waterfront park for education and wetland estuary. Construction began in September 2001, completing in December 2009.

Expansion was meant to accommodate the latest generation of container vessels. The design vessel for the project is a container ship that transports over 6500 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU’s) of containers. It has a design draft (depth in the water) of 46 ft., is 1,139 ft. long, and 140 ft. wide. Rhetoric around the expansion maintained that it was essential to the port's status as internationally-competitive. The dredging project was said to 'maintain and improve Oakland’s position as an international cargo gateway'.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Connected facilities:</strong></h3>
<h4><em>Intermodal facilities connected to port:
</em></h4>
Joint intermodal terminal completed in May 2, 2002 near-dock rail facilities to make the port more convenient for shippers and competitive with other west coast ports. It’s being operated by Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Rails Company (BNSF) as the Oakland International Gateway.

<h3><strong>Environmental Issues</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>News stories</strong></h3>
<h4><em>Environmental problems (water/air/noise/traffic/lights):</em></h4>
January 26, 2010 by Contra Costa Times, entitled “Day II: Health problems persist when options are limited: East Bay ZIP codes lacking middle-class amenities have higher rates of asthma, heart disease and cancer”, talks about East Bay neighborhoods residents dying of heart disease and cancer at three times the rate . West Oakland youths breathe in diesel exhaust from trucks, trains and ships at the port, and the aging homes near the waterfront become magnets for mold. One policy that many believe contributes to the high asthma rates is a truck ban on Interstate 580 in the upscale Oakland hills. This funnels large volumes of truck traffic through low-income communities lining Interstate 880 in west and East Oakland. The ban has existed since the freeway opened more than 40 years ago. In 2000, the California Trucking Association sought to overturn it, but ran into fierce opposition from hillside residents, the city councils of Oakland and San Leandro, and the Alameda County Board of Supervisors. After the public outcry, state lawmakers made the ban permanent. Alameda County health leaders and others have seized on a different target: the Port of Oakland, where they have fought to reduce diesel emissions from trucks, trains and ships. The diesel exhaust has led to a cancer risk in West Oakland that is three times higher than the Bay Area average, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District told federal officials in September. Another article entitled “Cleaner air for Oakland -- but no one wants to pay for it”, dated December 16, 2009, talks about the port's Clean Truck Management Plan (CTMP), The new rules are an effort to address the public health crisis in communities near the port, where diesel exhaust fumes have been contributing to rampant asthma and increased cancer rates. While no one questions the need for cleaner air, there's still a raging battle over who should pay to overhaul old, dirty trucks — and how to make it possible for small independent truckers not to lose their livelihoods. The Coalition for Clean and Safe Ports of Oakland (CCSP) is campaigning with Teamsters Union members and some truckers and Congress members to take the burden off independent owner- operators. But some say the industry model itself is the problem — that all the drivers should be employees of larger trucking firms that can pay for the latest equipment. Currently the drivers wait, engines idling, an average of 3.6 hours at or in the terminal. That's in part because they don't get hourly pay — which gives the shippers and trucking contractors little incentive to hurry things. In some ways, the problem is the result of the 1990s-era deregulation of the trucking industry. The Port of Oakland, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District set up a grant fund to help drivers retrofit their equipment to meet the new standards, and some did. But others who sold their older trucks and bought upgradeable models lost out when the money ran dry.

<strong>Port expansion plans:</strong> Expansion of the terminal is planned that would quadruple the capacity of the terminal to two million TEUs to meet the demands of continued growth in Asia-Pacific traffic trade.

<strong>The Fairview Container Terminal Development -- Phase 2</strong>

The vision of the future includes the expansion of the Fairview Container Terminal to quadruple the capacity of the facility to 2 million TEUs. The project will extend the wharf to 800 metres, achieve an 18 metre (59 feet) minimum water depth, increase the dock area to 56 hectares (139 acres), and quadruple to eight the number of post-panamax cranes. The expanded facility will have an on-site storage capacity of 28,560 TEUs at five high.
Phase 2 engineering design, environmental assessment and consultation are well underway.

At the Prince Rupert Port Authority, we're serious about environmental stewardship.

In all of its activities, the Port Authority is guided by key principles of environmental sustainability, including pollution prevention, preservation of environmental integrity, efficient use of resources, and continuous improvement.

This means complying with all applicable legislation, regulations, standards and internal policies, practices and procedures. Wherever technically and economically feasible, environmental best management practices will be integrated into operations and facilities.

Environmental conditions in the Port are documented and monitored on an ongoing basis, which enables the identification and assessment of environmental impacts arising from Port development and operations. The Port Authority is committed to take action to mitigate adverse environmental impacts arising from development and operations, and to build considerations of environmental sustainbility into planning, decision-making, and management processes.

The Prince Rupert Port Authority collaborates with other Port stakeholders. This includes working with Port tenants and users to promote their compliance with the established policies, practices, procedures, and guidelines.

Operated by National Distribution Centers of Delaware, Inc. and branded as NFI, a subsidiary. Staffing agency on-site, Warestaff, LLC, employs most workers on-site. The owner of the property, Swift Trucking, operates on half of the site, while NFI operates on the other half.

""The operation is dedicated 100% to moving goods destined for outlets at Walmart Stores, Inc. The facility has two sections, one dedicated to goods destined for the Sam’s Club subsidiary of Walmart, referred to as the West Side, and one dedicated to moving goods for the Walmart stores, referred to as the East Side. Workers are assigned to one or the other side.

The facility is a cross-dock operation, meaning goods are not stored on site, but rather are unloaded from shipping containers drayed from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, as well as trailers from regional distributors or producers. Workers unload boxes and pallets from the trailers and containers, either manually or using industrial trucks. The goods are then conveyed on carts, electric pallet jacks or forklift industrial truck across the dock to a different door and placed outside trailers backed up to the facility. Workers referred to as loaders then load boxes into trailer by hand, stacking them from the back of the trailer to the front.

The facility operates 24 hours a day, with reduced shifts on weekends. There are approximately 60 workers on site per shift. The bulk of workers are loaders and unloaders. Other workers drive forklifts. A small number of workers drive yard tractors, moving loaded and unloaded containers and trailers around the facility."" (from WWU Complaint)

""We appreciate your prompt consideration of this matter, as it represent a sharp escalation in the Employer's effort to squash organizational activity. The context for these charges is that on September 13,2012, thirty-three warehouse workers employed by Warestaff/NFI went on a fifteen-day strike to protest the Employer's previous unfair labor practices and ongoing work hazards that have been the subject of Cal-OSHA complaint and investigation. Now, as the enclosed charges describe, the Employer is retaliating against the returning strikers in ways both subtle and not, through discharges, temporary lay-offs, demotions, suspensions, and threats."" <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://empire-logistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Oct-2012-NLRB.pdf"">Download Complaint</a></span>

via <a href=""http://www.warehouseworkersunited.org/southern-california-warehouse-workers-on-strike/"">Warehouse Workers United</a>

RIVERSIDE, Calif. – Warehouse workers went on strike to protest unfair labor practices they have faced on the job Wednesday morning, following months of working in hot temperatures under extreme pressure in a major Walmart-contracted warehouse in Southern California.

Workers—who do not have a recognized union—walked off the job during the first shift at an NFI warehouse in Mira Loma, California to call for an end to retaliation and unfair labor practices. Workers have been fighting for more than a year for safe working conditions and for Walmart to take responsibility for conditions in the warehouse.

“When we spoke out to change terrible working conditions, workers were suspended, demoted and even fired. They spied on us and bullied us, all because we are fighting for dignity” said Limber Herrera, a warehouse worker for four years.

The strike comes one day before workers and their supporters begin a 50-mile, six-day pilgrimage from the warehouses to Downtown Los Angeles.

Workers face inadequate access to clean water, work under scorching heat that reaches well over 100 degrees, and have little access to basic healthcare, regular breaks, and properly functioning equipment. Their wages are low –$8 per hour and $250 a week, or $12,000 per year. Workplace injury is common.

But when workers tried to offer solutions to fix these abuses, they have been met with illegal threats and intimidation by management. Workers are employed by NFI and a temporary labor agency, Warestaff. Both companies are Walmart subcontractors, but the retail giant has ignored repeated attempts by workers to meet and address the inhumane and illegal conditions in its contracted warehouses.

As the largest retailer in the world, Walmart dictates the standards of operation in the logistics and distribution industry.

“These workers have exhausted all options,” said Guadalupe Palma, a director of Warehouse Workers United, an organization committed to improving warehousing jobs in Southern California’s Inland Empire. “Walmart must stop ignoring warehouse workers and intervene to uphold its own stated “Standards for Suppliers,” eliminate inhumane and illegal working conditions and sit down directly with warehouse workers to hear about their experiences in the warehouses and figure out how to improve working conditions.”

More than 85,000 workers labor in warehouses in Southern California, unloading merchandise from shipping containers that enter through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and loading it onto trucks destined for retail stores like Walmart. The National Labor Relations Board is currently investigating numerous federal charges filed by the warehouse workers.","NFI Warehouse@4100 Hamner Ave—Mira Loma, CA ",,"publish","open","closed",,"nfi-warehouse4100-hamner-ave-mira-loma-ca",,,"2013-11-29 21:42:19","2013-11-29 21:42:19",,"0","http://empire-logistics.org/?post_type=ait-dir-item&#038;p=2662","0","ait-dir-item",,"0"

The railyard is surrounded by commercial, industrial and residential areas. The nearest residential area located in the west is about 350 feet from the southern boundary of the yard. Bloomington Junior High School is also located south of the railyard. The main function of this yard is to break apart arriving trains and put them together based on their next destinations. The hump method is used to sort the trains. As they arrive, the trains are pushed up the hump and gravity allows the cars to roll in the center bowl, where they are sorted by computer controls to create a new outbound train.

In the warehouse industry, many workers, desperate for some source of income, suffer through unfavorable working conditions just to earn minimum wage. Most do not receive any benefits, and there is always a risk that they will not have a job the next morning because they work through temporary employment agencies. As high numbers of these workers are immigrants, many of them do not know their benefits as workers or do not stand up for those rights out of fear of being fired.

Warehouse Workers United (WWU) was organized several years ago in order to help warehouse workers in the Inland Empire obtain higher wages, better work conditions, health insurance and the ability to unionize without intimidation. Many of the workers are not hired directly from the warehouse, but rather from temporary agencies servicing the warehouses. Immigrant workers often do not understand their rights and lack knowledge of the industry.

Most workers are paid minimum wage for part time work. Yet, without many other alternatives, the warehouse workers hold onto these jobs because it does offer <em>some</em> source of income. They endure the low-wage work, lack of respect, sexual harassment of women workers, and injuries that come with the job. There is a fear to call in sick because managers often punish such workers by withholding shifts. Others fear to speak out because of the prospect of mass firings and deportation—constant threats faced by the undocumented.

“A lot of folks are immigrants. A lot of folks who are not in a position where they’re clear on what their rights are. They’re not in a position where they feel like they’re comfortable standing up for their rights as workers,” explains Sheheryar Kaoosji, who has been involved in the movement. “They deserve the same basic protections as any other worker in United States.” Yet these workers do not receive the basic protections that they deserve. Many have suffered on-the-job injuries and have been discouraged from reporting them, keeping a lot of what happens in the warehouses under a veil of secrecy.

A large percentage of domestic imports travel through the Inland Empire on their way to other parts of the country, making it an essential part of the global supply chain. However, due to employers who deny workers proper pay or benefits, the economy of the region has declined to one of the lowest in the state. Furthermore, pollution from diesel emissions ravage the local environment.","Warehouse Workers United ",,"publish","open","closed",,"warehouse-workers-united",,,"2013-11-29 23:02:42","2013-11-29 23:02:42",,"0","http://empire-logistics.org/?post_type=ait-dir-item&#038;p=2697","0","ait-dir-item",,"0"
